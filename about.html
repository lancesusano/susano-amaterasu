<p class="justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Southern Town started as a modern take of your classic neighbourhood barbershop and to serve as Slick Barbers Co.'s home in the south.  
Southern Town Social Club evolved into a commune where people can meet and enjoy their common interests: Classic haircuts, tattoos, and good clothes. Even if you're not particularly interested in getting a haircut,
to simply stay and relax in the said space is definitely an option to take. The warm welcome that the barbers exhibit will certainly establish a bond that lies outside a relationship formed merely by service; a bond of friendship will surface.

<p class="justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; The shop opens at around 12:00 PM and closes at around 8:00 PM. The shop is open for six days in a week, excluding Monday.
The price of the haircut depends whether the customer reserved his slot or not. In cases where a customer has settled an appointment beforehand, no matter how long the waiting line is, he/she will be treated with utmost priority.
The cost of a cut, prior to this regard, is 250 pesos. In the absence of a reservation slot, the cut will only cost 200 pesos. 
Worry not about the line, it often does not extend to a point where five people are pending. 
Apart from being a barbershop, the store is also considered as a tattoo parlor, local pomade central, and a hardware store of 
multiple styling equipments. The ambiance of the place brings back a touch of the 50s where the teddy-boy cut and the elephant trunk
are both styles of interest in terms of fashion. The shop can be found at 221 National Road, Barangay Bayanan Muntinlupa City. Coming from Alabang, it is situated
at the left side; whereas, coming from Laguna, it is situated at the right side. Well-known landmarks near the barbershop are Mercury Drug and Amber.
