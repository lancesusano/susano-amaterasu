&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; In the attempt of revitalizing the era of Grease and Jailhouse Rock, Southern Town
uses different measures of fashion such as: Clothing lines, Haircuts, and Music. In the words of their prominent barber: <em> "We are just a bunch of lads who wanted to cut hair. It was never really a job; it is what we love." </em>

&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Most of the barbers in Southern Town, apart from being identified as well-versed hair stylists, are also considered as prominent tattoo artists. With hopes of practicing their artistic tendencies with outlines and ink, an extension is attached within the space. 
Although, at the current status quo, tattoo discrimination exists within the nation, these artists inhibit in them a strong disposition to bend the stigma by exhibiting an enthusiastic and prosocial energy along with the promotion of the art. Southern Town also elevates Filipinos' feelings of patriotism by placing local products in the same pedestal of quality as those of foreign materials. Their actions imply that we, too, are competent enough to produce an art as aesthetically pleasing as those molded within the territorial boundaries of the dominant western culture. 
Their robust love for the arts and patriotism are qualities that could propell society forward. In this light, do support local products! Do drop by the shop!
